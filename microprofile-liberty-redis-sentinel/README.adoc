This project is intent to be a sample for MicroProfile with MongoDB integration by using Jakarta NoSQL implementation.

== Setup Redis

https://redis.com/[Redis] is a software project that implements data structure servers.
It is open-source, networked, in-memory, and stores keys with optional durability.

This required configuration to connect to Redis Sentinel is on the file `src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties`. More info about it, check the following link: https://github.com/eclipse/jnosql-databases?tab=readme-ov-file#configuration-14

[source,properties]
----
include::src/main/resources/META-INF/microprofile-config.properties[]
----
*PS:warning:* Pay attention to that when you try to set up your own Redis instance.

== Using Docker Compose

The easier way to execute this project is to use the provided docker-compose.yaml file in the root directory.
You can run it by performing the following command:

[source, bash]
----
docker-compose up -d
----

== Run the code

The generation of the executable jar file can be performed by issuing the following command
[source, bash]
----
mvn clean package
----

This will create an executable jar file **microprofile-liberty-redis.jar** within the _target_ maven folder. This can be started by executing the following command

[source, bash]
----
java -jar target/microprofile-liberty-redis.jar
----

=== Liberty Dev Mode

During development, you can use Liberty's development mode (dev mode) to code while observing and testing your changes on the fly.
With the dev mode, you can code along and watch the change reflected in the running server right away; 
unit and integration tests are run on pressing Enter in the command terminal; you can attach a debugger to the running server at any time to step through your code.

[source, bash]
----
mvn liberty:dev
----

To launch the test page, open your browser at the following URL

[source, text]
----
http://localhost:9080/index.html

=== Specification examples

By default, there is always the creation of a JAX-RS application class to define the path on which the JAX-RS endpoints are available.

Also, a simple Hello world endpoint is created, have a look at the class **HelloController**.

More information on MicroProfile can be found [here](https://microprofile.io/)


=== Config

Configuration of your application parameters. Specification [here](https://microprofile.io/project/eclipse/microprofile-config)

The example class **ConfigTestController** shows you how to inject a configuration parameter and how you can retrieve it programmatically.
